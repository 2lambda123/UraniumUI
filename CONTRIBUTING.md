 # Contributing Guideline
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to this project!

## Contribution Flow
Each contribution should start with an issue. You should [create an issue](https://github.com/enisn/UraniumUI/issues/new) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/enisn/UraniumUI/discussions/new) on the github repository.

### What you shouldn't do?
- Sending directly a PR ❌

### What you should do?
- Creating an Issue about your feature request or bug report. ✅
- Wait until the Issue is discussed and approved. ✅ _(You can fix obvious mistakes right away)_
- Then you can send a PR that closes the Issue. ✅

## Contributing to the docs
You can contribute to the docs by sending a PR to the [docs](https://github.com/enisn/UraniumUI/tree/develop/docs) folder. Changes will be deployed automatically on the [Uranium UI Documentation](https://enisn-projects.io/docs/en/uranium/latest)

Documentation also is versionned and each version has its own documentation. So, be sure about which version you're working on. Versions are related to branch names. For example, the `develop` branch is for the `latest` version of the docs and it's not relased yet. The `rel-2.1` branch is for the `2.1.*` version of the docs and it's released _(at least as preview version)_.
