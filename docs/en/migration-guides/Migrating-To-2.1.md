        .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
        {
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
            fonts.AddMaterialIconFonts();
        });
    ```

- You should add following style changes into your resources **if you overrided** the default style.
